# Browser
Basic Browser

For this python program to work, you must install PyTQ5 and PyQtWebEngine:
 - "pip install PyQt5" & "pip install PyQtWebEngine"

After this you can run the browser
 
# Reminders
 - It is a basic browser, when typing a url, links must be entered fully for it to work
    - "soccer teams"         X
    - "www.youtube.com"      X
    - "https://youtube.com"  O
 - The file "browser" is the basic template for making a browser
 - The file "GK_Browser" is my own custom browswer that I will constantly try to improve
